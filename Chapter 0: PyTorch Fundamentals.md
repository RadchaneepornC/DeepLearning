## What is Deep Learning

**Deep Learning** is a subset of machine learning, and machine learning is turning things (data: text, image, video) into numbers and finding patterns(by using code & math) in those numbers

- **Traditional programming:** rule based: put rules into the inputs to get the outputs
- **Machine learning algorithm:** findout rules from inputs and outputs

## Why use Machine Learning or Deep Learning ?

- For a complex problem, we can not think of all the rules, so ML and DL can help
  
**NOTE** If you can build a simple rule-based system that doesn't require machine learning to do that

**What deep learnign is good for**

- Problems with long lists of rules:  when the traditional approach fails, machine learning/deep learning may help
- Continually changing environments: deep learning can adapt ('learn') to new scenarios
- Discovering insighr with large collections of data: it is may not easy if we trying to hand-craft rules for diffenrentiating what 101 different kinds of food
  
**What deep learnign is not good for**
- When we need to explain the patterns since the patterns learned by a deep learnign model are typically uninterpretable by a human, it has a lot of numbers called weight and bias, has million, billion ofparameters(numbers or patterns in the data)
- When the traditional approach is a better option such as a simple rule-based system
- when errors are unacceptable since the outputs of deep learning model aren't always predictable
- when you don't have much data: deep learning models usually require a fairly large amount of data to produce great result
