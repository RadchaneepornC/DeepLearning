    A(Get the data ready, data is in the tensor) -->B(Build or pick a pretrain model)

## Introduction to Pytorch Workflow


## Getting setup

## Creating a dataset with linear regression

## Creating training and test sets (the most important concept in ML)

## Creating the PyTorch model

## Discussing important model building classes

## Checking out the internals of our model

## Making predictions with our model

## Training a model with PyTorch (intuition building)

## Setting up a loss function and optimizer

## PyTorch training loop intuition

## Running the training loop epoch by epoch

## Writing testing loop code

## Saving/loading a model

## Putting everything together
