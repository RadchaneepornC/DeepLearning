As there are several types of supervision as listed below

- **Supervised** : All labels known 
- **Semi-supervised** : Some labels known
- **Unsupervised** : No labels
- **Representation learning**
  - Transfer learning
  - Self-supervised learning: surrogate task from pseudo labels
- **Reinforcement learning** : Agent gathers data, reward function known

So, this note will focus on Semi-supervised and Representation learning types
