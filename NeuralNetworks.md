# DNNs (Deep Neural Networks)ðŸ§ 
## Introduction
**Q:** Why Deep Learning becomes popular today ? <br>

**A:** 
- It significant improved performance in NLP, ASR, Computer Vision, Robotics, Machine Translation, surpassed human performance in many tasks
- Big Data: DNN can take advantage of large amounts of data
- GPU: enable training bigger models possible
- Deep: Easier to avoid bad local minima when the model is large
